# Garry's Mod Pufferpanel Template
Custom Pufferpanel template for Garry's Mod

This template installs a gmod server, downloads cstrike files and has additional arguments.

Q1: Why does it download cstrike files?

A1: To make it easier for me to mount them everytime, rather than uploading them to new servers, it is just faster.


Q2: Why does it matter?

A2: When running a server with no mounted cstrike files, players with out CSS or a patch will see errors and missing textures everywhere. This prevents it


Q3: I still see missing textures, how can I fix this?

A3: You need to mount the cstrike files in /garrysmod/cfg/mount.cfg, there are tutorials online, I am still testing this to see what the correct paths are in order for this to work.

Currently, srcds (Source Dedicated Server) dependant game servers require you to install dependencies manually, not sure if there is a work around, but I will add it if I find it.

The Dependencies:
  lib32gcc1
  libsdl2-2.0-0:i386

If you know of a way to use (sudo) apt to install said dependencies within pufferpanel and get past the password enter prompt, please let me know.
