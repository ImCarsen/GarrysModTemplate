# Garry's Mod Pufferpanel Template
Custom Pufferpanel template for Garry's Mod

This is a work in progress, this does not create a fully functional server (yet).

Currently, srcds (Source Dedicated Server) dependant game servers require you to install dependency manually, not sure if there is a work around, but I will add it if I find it.
If you know of a way to use (sudo) apt to install said dependency within pufferpanel and get past the password enter promopt, please let me know.

The Dependency:
lib32gcc1

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.
